# Zoom Video Downloader

Download recorded Zoom videos from online, even if the video has downloading
disabled.



## About

Zoom is commonly used for remote academic lectures, particularly since the
COVID-19 pandemic forced many universities to transition to online education.
Professors often share recordings of their classes for students in other time
zones who are unable to watch the lectures live. However, watching videos
online may not be feasible for those with poor Internet connectivity. This can
be solved by allowing students to download the videos and watch them locally on
their computer without buffering, but not all professors set their lectures to
be downloadable when uploading Zoom recordings.

This extension provides a means to download any recorded video shared on Zoom,
whether the uploader makes it downloadable or not. It injects two download
buttons into the page: one for downloading the recorded video itself, and one
for downloading the chats as subtitles.

Downloading lectures also enables all students to re-watch the videos at faster
or slower speeds to suit their needs. It likewise enables analyzing videos with
automated transcription and eases reviewing material. Furthermore, students
deserve access to course materials, even after completing a course.



## Installation

There is an unlisted Chrome extension uploaded to the Chrome Web Store
available here:

Otherwise, clone the repository and enable [developer
mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01). Then point
Chrome to the location of the cloned repository. This option is not preferable
since developer mode in Chrome creates an annoying dialog every time the
browser is restarted.
